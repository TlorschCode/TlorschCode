Hey, I'm @TlorschCode.

I like coding, creating cool stuff in blender, reading fantasy novels, and other notably nerdy stuff.

I'm learning C++, although I already knokw a lot. I want to learn JavaScript, and I want to learn to create windows apps.

He/Him.

Currently: procrastinating my next school assignment...

Have a great day :D
