# Hey, I'm @TlorschCode.

I'm a 15 year old who likes programming in C++, writing essays (sometiems), reading fantasy novels, and hanging with friends.

I started my coding journey with Python, but now I only use it for quick projects and scripts. I enjoy the strongly typed structure of C++ more. I've touched Java a few times, but not enough to write anything meaningful in it.
Since C++ is my goto, I've started learning OpenGL. I somehow managed to learn CUDA before OpenGL, so I'm catching up. My current goal is to make GPU-driven cell-based simulations, like Conway's Game of Life at 100x scale, but with more complex rules and more types of cells. (Sebastian Lague has some great examples in an [old video]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzwT3wQWAHE&t=95s&pp=ygUYc2ViYXN0aWFuIGxhZ3VlIGxpZmUgc2lt)) on his channel)

I also participate in Vex Robotics. Three words. Odometry is hard. (Pure pursuit might be harder if I'm being honest)

**Currently**: Trying to decipher an OpenGL tutorial on YouTube.

Have a great day :D
