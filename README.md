Hey, I'm @TlorschCode.

I'm a 15 year old who likes programming, creating (not so) cool stuff in Blender, reading fantasy novels, and other notably nerdy stuff.

Python is basically the language I speak in, and I'm fluent in C++, but I also know a good deal of C#, and some relatively basic Java, which I want to learn more of. I kind of want to learn JavaScript too, but don't really have an interest in Web Development. 

Oh, and I'm part of a robotics league, and am pretty much the only person who knows how to code. In a nutshell, odometry is hard.

Currently: Struggling over SolidWorks.

Have a great day :D
